Run Beat Saber as a **native Windows ARM64** program on ARM64 Linux under Proton, tested on the
**Steam Frame**, instead of emulating the x64 build with FEX. Every game version on Unity 6000.0.40f1
works, which means 1.40.9 through 1.44.1 (see [Game versions](#game-versions)); the benchmarks below
are from 1.44.1.

The game's engine and C# code both run natively. Only Proton's small `steam.exe` launcher stays x64.

## Results on the Steam Frame

Beat Saber 1.44.1, the same replay (STARLIGHT, Expert+, 1,050 notes) five times on each build,
alternating:

| | Native ARM64 | x64 via FEX |
|---|---|---|
| Frames rendered (same 184 s song) | ~22,150 (~120 fps) | ~19,130 (~104 fps) |
| Mean frame time | 8.34 ms | 9.66 ms |
| 99th percentile frame time | 10.4 ms | 18.5 ms |
| Frames over 9.5 ms | 4.5 % | 35.1 % |
| Reprojected frames (SteamVR) | 1.0 % | 30.9 % |
| Dropped frames (SteamVR) | 2 | 159–176 |
| App CPU time per frame (SteamVR) | 4.24 ms | 8.39 ms |
| App GPU time per frame (SteamVR) | 3.26 ms | 8.24 ms |
| CPU temperature, mean (max) | 65.5 °C (74.9) | 75.6 °C (83.6) |
| GPU temperature, mean (max) | 56.8 °C (59.5) | 71.0 °C (77.5) |
| Fast core (X4) clock | 2294 MHz | 2797 MHz |
| GPU clock | 901 MHz | 897 MHz |
| System power during the song | 14.4 W | 19.2 W |
| GPU power | 2.0 W | 3.4 W |
| CPU power | 3.4 W | 4.2 W |

Both builds ran with the same configuration:

- **2160 × 2160 per eye at 120 Hz** (SteamVR's per-app resolution and refresh rate for Beat Saber).
- **Foveated rendering on**: SteamVR's own (`FDM_DEBUG=enable`, Steam's default strength), see
  [Foveated rendering](#foveated-rendering-optional).
- The same `settings.ini`, changed from the game's defaults: anti-aliasing 2× (default 4×), Bloom Post
  Process off (`quality.main_fx`), mirror off, smoke off, Screen Distortion off
  (`quality.screen_displacement_fx`), shockwave particles 0.
- Proton 11.0-2c (ARM64), the same Wine prefix, the fan at a fixed speed.
- The game with only BSIPA and a test plugin that plays the replay through the game's own systems:
  the sabers and the view follow the recorded hands and head, and the recorded cuts go through the
  game's cut handling (debris, effects, sounds, score). Every run cut all 1,050 notes.

Frame times are per frame from the game; reprojected and dropped frames and app CPU/GPU time come
from SteamVR's per-session compositor stats; temperatures, clocks and power are sampled every ~2.5 s
while the song plays. Between runs the spread was under 0.1 ms for CPU and GPU time.

The native build halves the CPU time per frame. The GPU time is lower too, partly because the ARM64 build
brings its own DXVK build, which doesn't write the multisampled image back after resolving it (see
[CHANGELOG](CHANGELOG.md) 0.1.6).

With the game's default graphics settings (anti-aliasing 4×, Bloom Post Process, mirror, smoke and
Screen Distortion on, shockwave particles 1), everything else the same, the GPU is the limit on both
builds and the native build barely helps (two runs each):

| Default graphics settings | Native ARM64 | x64 via FEX |
|---|---|---|
| Frames rendered (same 184 s song) | ~7,240 (~39 fps) | ~7,200 (~39 fps) |
| Mean frame time | 25.5 ms | 25.7 ms |
| Reprojected frames (SteamVR) | 81 % | 89 % |
| App GPU time per frame (SteamVR) | 18.6 ms | 20.3 ms |

At 2160 × 2160 and 120 Hz, lower these settings first; which of them costs the most wasn't measured
separately.

A CPU micro-benchmark run inside the game's Mono runtime shows the CPU gain on its own: native code is
2–3× faster than FEX-translated x64 on everything except `Vector3` math (see
[docs/upstream/FINDINGS.md](docs/upstream/FINDINGS.md#benchmark)).

## Tip: turn off Adaptive SFX

Turn off **Adaptive SFX**: Solo → song selection → **Player Settings** tab in the panel next to the song
list (not the main menu's Options). It measures the song's loudness on the audio thread with thousands
of `Math.Pow` calls per second. On x64 that's cheap; on ARM64, Mono's `pow` is
slow and the measurement takes most of the audio thread. With it off, frame times were steadier in a
replay benchmark: 30 % fewer frames over 9.5 ms at 120 Hz. The trade-off: hit sounds no longer adapt
to the song's loudness. See [docs/upstream/FINDINGS.md](docs/upstream/FINDINGS.md#frame-pacing).

## Tip: turn off Screen Distortion

In the game's graphics settings, turn off **Screen Distortion**. For the effect, the game copies the
whole scene in the middle of every frame and keeps drawing on it, which costs a lot of GPU time on the
Frame's tiled GPU. In v0.1.6 it also caused frozen ghost images of the menu and sabers.

## Foveated rendering (optional)

With foveated rendering the Frame's GPU renders the area you look at in full resolution and the edges
at lower resolution. bs-arm64 uses SteamVR's own foveated rendering (Valve's `fdm_injection` layer),
the same one Steam turns on for the x64 game with **Properties** → **Performance** → **Foveated
Rendering**. With SteamVR's eye tracking the sharp area follows your eyes.

By hand, start the game with `bs-arm64.sh launch --foveation`. That sets what Steam sets:
`FDM_DEBUG=enable` and `VK_INSTANCE_LAYERS=VK_LAYER_VALVE_rpo:VK_LAYER_VALVE_fdm_injection`. Steam's
default is mild; `FDM_DEBUG=enable,med` or `FDM_DEBUG=enable,hi` saves more and is easier to notice.
The BSManager fork (v1.6.0-frame.4 or later) sets them from Steam's Foveated Rendering switch.

| STARLIGHT replay, 1776 px per eye, no MSAA, 120 Hz | GPU / frame | CPU / frame | System power |
|---|---|---|---|
| off | 3.83 ms | 5.28 ms | 17.7 W |
| default | 2.92 ms | 4.70 ms | 15.7 W |
| `hi` | 2.64 ms | 4.62 ms | 15.2 W |

One run each, headset off (no eye movement). bs-arm64 0.2.0's own foveated rendering got 3.16 ms GPU
and 5.37 ms CPU in the same test, so it was removed.

AssetBundleLoadingTools' **Enable Multi-Pass Rendering** (Mod Settings, or `EnableMultiPassRendering`
in `UserData/AssetBundleLoadingTools.json`) makes the game draw everything twice, once per eye. It
also kept 0.2.0's foveated rendering off; Valve's layer hasn't been tried with it. Check it when you
copy `UserData` over from a Windows install.

## What works

| Area | Status |
|---|---|
| Menu, maps (official), audio, visuals | ✅ |
| Steam (login, ownership, platform init, online services) | ✅ |
| OpenXR on SteamVR, controllers, recenter | ✅ |
| Burst-compiled code | ⚠️ x64 `lib_burst_generated.dll` can't load; Unity falls back to managed code |
| LIV mixed-reality capture | ❌ not available (a stub `LIV_Bridge.dll` reports "no capture") |
| Mods: BSIPA 4.3.7 + Harmony (tested: SiraUtil, BSML, SongCore, BS Utils) | ✅ with the ARM64 Doorstop + upstream MonoMod.Core 1.3.4, on 1.41.1 and later |
| Game versions | ✅ 1.40.9 through 1.44.1 (Unity 6000.0.40f1); other Unity engines aren't supported |

## Game versions

The native runtime depends on the game's Unity engine, not on its version: the installer reads the
engine from the instance's `globalgamemanagers` and refuses any other than 6000.0.40f1. Tested on the
Frame, to the main menu with Steam and VR:

| Beat Saber | Steamworks SDK | Without mods | With mods |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1.40.8 and older | | ❌ Unity 2022.3.33f1, the installer refuses it | |
| 1.40.9 – 1.40.13 | 1.57 | ✅ Steam (ownership, DLC, leaderboards), VR | BeatMods has no mods for these versions |
| 1.41.1 | 1.61 | ✅ | ✅ |
| 1.42.0 – 1.42.3 | 1.61 | ✅ | ✅ |
| 1.43.0, 1.44.0, 1.44.1 | 1.61 | ✅ | ✅ |

`steam_api64.dll` implements the SDK 1.61 flat API and also serves games built against older SDKs:
it exports their entry points (e.g. `SteamAPI_Init`) and hands out its own interface versions when a
game asks for older ones ([ARCHITECTURE.md](docs/upstream/ARCHITECTURE.md#steam-steam_api64dll--lsteamclient_a64dll)).

## How it works

The ARM64 player comes from the same Unity version the game was built with (6000.0.40f1). Every native
piece around it that only existed as x64 or ARM64EC has an ARM64 replacement. Details are in
[docs/upstream/ARCHITECTURE.md](docs/upstream/ARCHITECTURE.md).

| Piece | Source |
|---|---|
| Unity player, `UnityPlayer.dll`, Mono runtime | Unity's official Windows ARM64 player (downloaded) |
| `steam_api64.dll` | **new**: Steamworks SDK 1.61 flat API, plus the entry points of older SDKs ([src/steam-api](src/steam-api)) |
| `lsteamclient_a64.dll` | Proton's lsteamclient, Windows half, rebuilt for pure aarch64 |
| `wineopenxr_a64.dll` | Proton's wineopenxr, Windows half, rebuilt for pure aarch64 |
| `openxr_loader.dll` | Khronos loader 1.1.45, patched ([patches/openxr-loader](patches/openxr-loader)) |
| `UnityOpenXR.dll` | Unity's UWP ARM64 build, imports patched for desktop ([src/unityopenxr](src/unityopenxr)) |
| `dxgi.dll`, `d3d11.dll` | DXVK at Proton's commit, built for aarch64 ([patches/dxvk](patches/dxvk)) |
| `MonoPosixHelper.dll` | Mono's zlib helper + zlib; Unity doesn't ship one for ARM64 |
| `ucrtbs64.dll`, `vcruntime140.dll`, `msvcp140.dll` | private Wine ARM64 C++ runtime, built from the matching Proton source with the upstream exception-handling fix ([patches/wine](patches/wine)) |
| `winhttp.dll` (mods) | BSIPA's Doorstop injector, rebuilt for ARM64 ([src/doorstop](src/doorstop)) |
| `Libs/MonoMod.Core.dll` (mods) | unmodified upstream MonoMod.Core 1.3.4, which includes Windows ARM64 support |

## Quick start

### With BSManager (easiest)

The Steam Frame fork of BSManager, [DaVarga/bs-manager](https://github.com/DaVarga/bs-manager)
(ARM64 AppImage on its releases page), fixes BSManager for ARM64 Proton and adds an **ARM64 tab**
next to Mods for supported versions. That tab downloads the release matching your Proton build and
installs, reinstalls or removes it, with or without mod support. It also re-applies the ARM64 mod
loader fixes after BSIPA is installed, and sets up the launch environment.

Follow its [Steam Frame guide](https://github.com/DaVarga/bs-manager/blob/bs-arm64/docs/steam-frame.md).
On a fresh Frame, three things trip people up:
- Install **Proton 11.0 (ARM64)** (and **Steam Linux Runtime 4.0 for arm64**) from the Steam library
  (Tools) first; BSManager asks for the Proton folder.
- Add `DISABLE_VULKAN_FDM_INJECTION_LAYER=1 %command%` as launch command in BSManager. Without it the
  game hangs at startup: Valve's foveated rendering layer is half on outside Steam. For foveated
  rendering in the x64 game, use
  `FDM_DEBUG=enable VK_INSTANCE_LAYERS=VK_LAYER_VALVE_rpo:VK_LAYER_VALVE_fdm_injection %command%`
  instead.
- Launch the version once before clicking Install in the ARM64 tab. That creates BSManager's Wine prefix.
  If Install already failed with `Wine prefix … does not exist`, the version is left half changed;
  launch another version once, then click Install again.

### By hand

On the Steam Frame, with BSManager, an instance of 1.40.9 through 1.44.1 (Unity 6000.0.40f1), and
"Proton 11.0 (ARM64)":

Download the release tarball that matches your Proton version (`<Proton dir>/version`) from the
[releases page](https://github.com/DaVarga/bs-arm64/releases), then on the Frame:

```sh
tar xf bs-arm64-*.tar.gz && cd bs-arm64-*/
./bs-arm64.sh install ~/.local/share/BSManager/BSInstances/1.44.1   # downloads the Unity player etc.
./bs-arm64.sh launch  ~/.local/share/BSManager/BSInstances/1.44.1
```

Or build it yourself:

```sh
# 1. build the open-source parts (any Linux host, x86_64 or aarch64); see docs/upstream/BUILD.md
./build.sh
# 2. copy the repo (with out/) to the Frame, then there:
install/bs-arm64.sh install ~/.local/share/BSManager/BSInstances/1.44.1
install/bs-arm64.sh launch  ~/.local/share/BSManager/BSInstances/1.44.1
# undo:
install/bs-arm64.sh uninstall ~/.local/share/BSManager/BSInstances/1.44.1
```

See [docs/upstream/INSTALL.md](docs/upstream/INSTALL.md) for every file that gets touched.

> **Status:** verified end to end on the Frame. A clean `build.sh` output was installed with
> `install/bs-arm64.sh` into a fresh copy of a BSManager 1.44.1 instance: Steam, VR and maps all work.
> The other versions in [Game versions](#game-versions) were tested to the main menu with Steam and VR.
