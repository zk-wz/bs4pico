# Architecture

## Starting point

Beat Saber 1.40.9 through 1.44.1 are Unity 6000.0.40f1 games, built with the Mono scripting backend
for Windows x64. Everything below was worked out on 1.44.1.
The Steam Frame runs it through Proton 11.0 (ARM64), in these steps:

1. Wine's own code (ntdll, kernel32, …) is ARM64/ARM64X.
2. The game's x64 code (`UnityPlayer.dll`, Mono's JIT output, every native plugin) runs through
   **FEX** as ARM64EC.
3. Proton's game-facing modules (DXVK, lsteamclient, wineopenxr) are **ARM64EC** builds, so an x64
   process can load them.

A perf profile of gameplay showed that the main thread spends 83–87% of its time in
FEX-translated code (`[anon:FEXMemJIT]`). The game is CPU-bound, and rendering resolution barely matters.

Unity ships a Windows ARM64 player for the same engine version (module "Windows Build Support (Mono)",
variation `win_arm64_player_nondevelopment_mono`). Game code is IL in `Managed/*.dll` and game data is
engine-version specific but architecture independent. So swapping the player binaries gives a native
ARM64 process that runs the unmodified game data and assemblies.

A pure ARM64 process can't load x64 or ARM64EC code. Every native module the game touches needs a
pure ARM64 version, and that is what this project provides.

## Components

### Unity ARM64 player

Source: `UnitySetup-Windows-Mono-Support-for-Editor-6000.0.40f1.pkg`, from Unity's CDN (the macOS
target-support package; it contains every Windows player variation).
[`tools/unity_pkg_extract.py`](../../tools/unity_pkg_extract.py) streams the xar → gzip → cpio chain
and keeps only four files:

- `WindowsPlayer.exe` → `Beat Saber.exe`
- `UnityPlayer.dll`
- `UnityCrashHandler64.exe`
- `MonoBleedingEdge/EmbedRuntime/mono-2.0-bdwgc.dll`

The ARM64 player looks up native plugins in `Beat Saber_Data/Plugins/ARM64/`, not `Plugins/x86_64/`.

### Steam: `steam_api64.dll` + `lsteamclient_a64.dll`

Valve ships no Windows ARM64 `steam_api64.dll`. Proton's `lsteamclient.dll`, which is what
`steam_api` normally loads as `steamclient64.dll`, is ARM64EC only.

**lsteamclient_a64.dll.** Proton's lsteamclient is split in two halves:

- A Windows half: thunks that marshal every interface call into a parameter struct.
- A unix half, `lsteamclient.so`, which calls the native Linux `steamclient.so`.

The two halves talk through Wine's unix-call interface (`__wine_unix_call`). The Windows half is plain C
and already handles `__aarch64__`, so we build it from the Proton tag matching the installed
Proton. The compiler is llvm-mingw's `aarch64-w64-mingw32-clang`, using Wine's headers and a tiny
`winecrt0` shim. The unix half is reused as is.

Callbacks are polled (`steamclient_next_callback`), so no unix→PE calls are needed.

We name it `lsteamclient_a64` so Wine can't pick Proton's ARM64EC `lsteamclient.dll`, which comes
first in Wine's DLL search path. Its unix half is a symlink, `lsteamclient_a64.so` → Proton's
`lsteamclient.so`. Wine only loads a unix half for DLLs it treats as *builtin*, so we:

- stamp the "Wine builtin DLL" marker into the DOS header,
- put the DLL in `$WINEDLLPATH/aarch64-windows/` and the symlink in `$WINEDLLPATH/aarch64-unix/`,
- have `steam_api64.dll` load that file by its full path.

Loading by full path is what makes it work: Wine resolves a builtin through `WINEDLLPATH` only after
it finds a builtin-marked file on the normal search path, or one given by path.

**steam_api64.dll.** This is a new implementation of the Steamworks SDK 1.61 flat API. It
exports all 1,089 symbols of the real DLL, plus 11 entry points of older SDKs (1,100 in total).

- **Interface wrappers.** [`gen.py`](../../src/steam-api/gen.py) generates 946 `SteamAPI_ISteamX_Method`
  wrappers from `steam_api_flat.h`. Each one calls into the interface's vtable. Vtable indices come
  from lsteamclient's own vtable definitions for the interface versions of SDK 1.61. Overloads are
  resolved through `STEAM_FLAT_NAME` and MSVC's reversed overload order. All 879 indices that can be
  checked match the offsets disassembled from the real x64 `steam_api64.dll`.
- **Struct returns.** Methods that return a struct (`CSteamID`, `SteamIPAddress_t`, …) take a hidden
  `_ret` pointer after `this` in lsteamclient. The generator detects them and wraps them.
- **Core** ([`steam_api_core.cpp`](../../src/steam-api/steam_api_core.cpp)):
  - init: `SteamInternal_SteamAPI_Init` → `CreateInterface("SteamClient021")` → pipe → global user →
    interface version check
  - `SteamInternal_ContextInit`, `FindOrCreateUserInterface`
  - manual dispatch, mapped to lsteamclient's `Steam_BGetCallback`, `Steam_FreeLastCallback` and
    `Steam_GetAPICallResult`
  - the legacy `CCallback`/`CCallResult` dispatch, using the MSVC vtable layout
  - shutdown
  - game-server entry points, which are stubbed
- **Helpers** ([`steam_api_helpers.cpp`](../../src/steam-api/steam_api_helpers.cpp)):
  - the flat accessors (`SteamAPI_SteamUser_v023`, …)
  - `SteamNetworkingIPAddr`/`Identity`/`servernetadr_t` helpers
  - `ISteamNetworkingUtils` inline convenience methods
- **Older SDKs.** Beat Saber 1.40.9–1.40.13 use Steamworks.NET 20.2, built for SDK 1.57. Valve's
  `steam_api64.dll` changes its exports between SDK versions, and a game ships the one it was built
  with; ours serves both:
  - It exports the old entry points: `SteamAPI_Init`, `SteamInternal_GameServer_Init`,
    `SteamAPI_ISteamClient_GetISteamAppList` and `SteamNetworkingIdentity` `Get`/`SetStadiaID`.
  - When a game asks for an older version of an interface this DLL implements
    (`STEAMUSERSTATS_INTERFACE_VERSION012`, `SteamClient020`, …), it gets ours (`…013`,
    `SteamClient021`) instead. The generated wrappers call our versions' vtables, and a game calls the
    flat functions by name, so its calls land on the right methods. `shim_map_interface_version`
    does this in `FindOrCreateUserInterface`, `SteamInternal_CreateInterface` and the
    `ISteamClient::GetISteamX` wrappers. Newer versions than ours are left alone.
  - Flat functions that newer SDKs dropped (`ISteamUserStats_RequestCurrentStats`, the
    `ISteamAppList` methods) call lsteamclient's implementation of the old interface version, so Steam
    still answers them (`LEGACY` in `gen.py`).
- **ABI rule.** This DLL is compiled with the Itanium C++ ABI (mingw). It never makes a C++ virtual call.
  All calls into Steam objects go through typed function pointers taken from the MSVC-layout
  vtables.

Env var `STEAMAPI_ARM64_LOG=1` logs init and interface version mapping to stderr; any other value is
a file to append to (a Windows path, e.g. `Z:\tmp\steam_api.log`). A build with
`STEAM_API_CFLAGS=-DSHIM_TRACE_CALLS ./build.sh steam-api` also logs every flat call, callback and call
result; it's for debugging only.

`steam_api64.dll` looks for `lsteamclient_a64.dll` in this order:
1. the name in `STEAMAPI_ARM64_CLIENT_DLL`
2. next to itself
3. `C:\bs-arm64\aarch64-windows\`, the installer's location
4. the normal DLL search path

### OpenXR

**UnityOpenXR.dll.** The Unity OpenXR package (1.14.3, the version the game ships, byte-identical)
contains an ARM64 build only for UWP. [`patch_unityopenxr.py`](../../src/unityopenxr/patch_unityopenxr.py)
rewrites three imports so it loads in a desktop process:

- `MSVCP140_APP` → `msvcp140`
- `VCRUNTIME140_APP` → `vcruntime140`
- `api-ms-win-core-libraryloader-l2-1-0!LoadPackagedLibrary` → `kernel32!LoadLibraryW`. Wine's
  `LoadPackagedLibrary` is a stub. The extra `reserved` argument is harmless under the ARM64
  calling convention.

The UWP build loads `openxr_loader.dll` by bare name, so a copy must sit next to the exe.

**openxr_loader.dll.** Khronos publishes no desktop ARM64 loader, so we build 1.1.45 (the game's
version) with llvm-mingw. [Patches](../../patches/openxr-loader/0001-wine-arm64-runtime-discovery.patch):

- **Registry lookup.** The loader reads `HKLM\Software\Khronos\OpenXR\1\ActiveRuntimeARM64` before
  `ActiveRuntime`. Proton's `ActiveRuntime` points at the ARM64EC wineopenxr, and Proton rewrites that
  value on every launch.
- **Env override.** The override variable is named `XR_RUNTIME_JSON_ARM64` and isn't dropped for
  "elevated" processes. Every Wine process looks elevated to the loader.
- **MinGW build fixes.** CMake gets the MinGW export fix (`.def` file, static runtime, no `lib`
  prefix) and a missing `<iterator>` include.

**wineopenxr_a64.dll.** This is Proton's wineopenxr Windows half built for pure aarch64, the same way
as lsteamclient. It imports `winevulkan` (ARM64X in Proton) and `dxgi`. Its unix half is a symlink to
Proton's `wineopenxr.so`.

The runtime JSON (`C:\bs-arm64\wineopenxr_a64.json`) points at the DLL by path. The builtin marker
makes Wine resolve it through `WINEDLLPATH` by name, so the name must not be `wineopenxr.dll`.

Building wineopenxr needs Wine's IDL-generated headers (`d3d11.h`, …) and `wine/vulkan.h`. Those come
from Wine's own `widl` and `make_vulkan`, run on the pinned Wine commit.

### Graphics: DXVK

Proton's DXVK in `lib/wine/dxvk/aarch64-windows` is ARM64EC, and Wine's own `d3d11`/`dxgi` (WineD3D)
are ARM64X. WineD3D can boot the game, but it has no DXVK interop, and wineopenxr needs that interop to
share D3D11 textures with Vulkan. `xrCreateSession` then fails with `XR_ERROR_VALIDATION_FAILURE`.

We build DXVK at Proton's commit for aarch64 (DXVK's `DXVK_ARCH_ARM64` code path; x86 intrinsics are
guarded). Only two missing-include fixes for libc++ are needed. `dxgi.dll` and `d3d11.dll` go next to
the exe. The app directory wins over the ARM64EC DXVK that Proton copies into `system32`.

One optimization for the Frame's tiled GPU
([patches/dxvk/0003-discard-resolved-msaa.patch](../../patches/dxvk/0003-discard-resolved-msaa.patch)):
Beat Saber draws the whole scene in one pass, 2160×2160 with 2 layers (both eyes) and 2× MSAA, and
resolves it inside the pass. DXVK then still stored the multisampled color and depth to memory, about
150 MB per frame that nothing reads. The patch stores them as `DONT_CARE` when a multisampled pass has a
resolve. `BS_ARM64_KEEP_MSAA=1` restores DXVK's behavior.

With **Screen Distortion** on, Unity resolves the scene for the effect and then keeps drawing on the
multisampled target, so a later pass loads what we discarded. That showed stale images (frozen
menu, ghost sabers) in v0.1.6.
[patches/dxvk/0005-keep-loaded-msaa-targets.patch](../../patches/dxvk/0005-keep-loaded-msaa-targets.patch)
remembers which targets were discarded. When a pass loads one of them, DXVK stores that target again
from then on and logs `MSAA: … storing it from now on`. At most one frame shows stale contents.
Without Screen Distortion nothing loads them, and the saving stays.

Foveated rendering is Valve's `fdm_injection` layer, see
[Foveated rendering](#foveated-rendering-valves-fdm_injection).

### MonoPosixHelper.dll

Beat Saber stores beatmaps gzip-compressed and reads them with `System.IO.Compression.GZipStream`.
Unity's Mono implements that via P/Invoke into `MonoPosixHelper.dll` (`CreateZStream`, …). Unity's
ARM64 player doesn't ship one, and the leftover x64 one can't load. The failure is swallowed:
`ReadAllTextFromData` returns null, and the game reports "Could not load readonly beatmap level data"
and returns to the menu.

We build Mono's `support/zlib-helper.c` (Unity's fork) with zlib 1.3.1 and a minimal glib shim
([src/monoposixhelper](../../src/monoposixhelper)).

### LIV_Bridge.dll

The game includes the LIV SDK (mixed reality capture). `LIV.dll` P/Invokes `LIV_Bridge`, which
only exists as `Plugins/x86_64/LIV_Bridge.dll`. On ARM64 every call threw `DllNotFoundException`,
about once per frame, and BSIPA logged each one. That cost about 0.6 ms of CPU per frame.

[src/liv-bridge/liv_bridge.c](../../src/liv-bridge/liv_bridge.c) exports the same 31 functions, and
each returns 0. `LivCaptureIsActive()` is then false, and the SDK stays idle.

### Private Wine C++ runtime

`UnityOpenXR` throws and catches a C++ exception when the tracking origin changes (recenter, headset
put on). Proton's unpatched ARM64 `__CxxFrameHandler3` (in ucrtbase) dereferences NULL on this
MSVC-compiled code, and the game crashes.

Earlier releases downloaded Microsoft's ARM64 runtime to work around it. We now build Wine's
`vcruntime140.dll` and `msvcp140.dll` with a private UCRT, `ucrtbs64.dll`, from the Wine source matching
the bundled Proton. [patches/wine](../../patches/wine) backports the upstream exception-handling fix and
changes both import/forwarder references and the C++ library's dynamic UCRT lookups to the private name.

Wine master merged a fix for this crash in
[6964eb2](https://github.com/wine-mirror/wine/commit/6964eb2b018a9029b561124269e7ceec5bde8086)
(2026-10-02). Our pinned Proton predates it, so we carry the backport in the private runtime
(see [UPSTREAM](UPSTREAM.md#2-wine-arm64-c-exception-handling)).

All three DLLs are ordinary ARM64 PE files, built without Wine's builtin marker. They live beside
the ARM64 executable and leave the prefix's shared `ucrtbase.dll` and runtime overrides untouched.
This also keeps Proton's x64 `steam.exe` launcher and retail/x64 Beat Saber working. No BSM update
or launch-setting change is needed. Pure ARM64 uses `__CxxFrameHandler3`; `vcruntime140_1.dll` is not
needed by this game's ARM64 binaries.

## Mods (BSIPA)

BSIPA works on the ARM64 build once two of its native/low-level pieces are replaced. The
installer does this automatically when it finds BSIPA in the instance (`winhttp.dll`).

**Doorstop (`winhttp.dll`).** BSIPA injects itself through its fork of Unity Doorstop: a `winhttp.dll`
proxy in the game folder. It hooks `GetProcAddress` in `UnityPlayer.dll`'s import table and loads
`IPA.Injector.dll` when Mono initialises. The ARM64 `UnityPlayer.dll` imports `GetProcAddress`,
`GetMessageA`/`PeekMessageA` and `WINHTTP.dll` exactly like x64, so the hooks work unchanged. Only
the binary is x64. We build BSIPA's Doorstop source for ARM64. Its MSVC-specific parts are handled
by [src/doorstop](../../src/doorstop):
- **Mini CRT:** Doorstop brings its own, which is renamed so it doesn't clash with the mingw headers.
- **winhttp forwarding stubs:** they're generated as explicit `adrp/add/ldr/br x16` jumps, instead
  of relying on MSVC turning a C call into a tail jump.

`launch` sets `WINEDLLOVERRIDES=winhttp=n,b` so the proxy in the game folder is used.

**MonoMod.Core (Harmony).** Harmony 2.x patches methods through MonoMod.Core 1.3.3, which already has
an ARM64 detour backend. Its `WindowsSystem` only defines the default calling convention for x86 and
x64, so on Windows ARM64 it throws `Cannot use Mono system, because the underlying system doesn't
provide a default ABI!`.

Upstream MonoMod.Core 1.3.4 includes the Windows ARM64 ABI, matching the description MonoMod uses
on Linux and macOS ARM64. For Mono's own code, Windows ARM64 follows AAPCS64: `this` in x0, the
return buffer in x8, and the same type classification.

The release ships the unmodified upstream `net452` DLL from its SHA256-pinned NuGet package.
The installer upgrades BSIPA's `1.3.3+aa4a84749` DLL and earlier bs-arm64 patched builds, preserving
the original backup. Other versions are left alone. No local MonoMod patch or build is needed.

**BSIPA's anti-piracy check.** `AntiPiracy.IsInvalid` refuses to load if any file whose name
contains "steam" is 350 KB or larger in the game folder or `Beat Saber_Data/Plugins`. That heuristic
catches Steam emulators. Our DLLs are not emulators: they go through the real Steam client and its
ownership check. We keep them out of the heuristic's range legitimately:
- `lsteamclient_a64.dll` lives only in the prefix runtime directory, `C:\bs-arm64\aarch64-windows`.
  `steam_api64.dll` looks for it there.
- `steam_api64.dll` is 96 KB: no C++ runtime, `-Os`, stripped. The real x64 one is 319 KB.
  `build.sh` fails if it grows to 350 KB.

## Wine prefix and launch environment

The installer ([install/bs-arm64.sh](../../install/bs-arm64.sh)) adds these to the prefix:

- `pfx/drive_c/bs-arm64/` (`C:\bs-arm64`), used as `WINEDLLPATH`:
  - `aarch64-windows/lsteamclient_a64.dll`, `aarch64-windows/wineopenxr_a64.dll`
  - `aarch64-unix/lsteamclient_a64.so`, `aarch64-unix/wineopenxr_a64.so`: symlinks into Proton
  - `wineopenxr_a64.json`
  - `proton-version`: the Proton build the halves must match
- registry: `HKLM\Software\Khronos\OpenXR\1` `ActiveRuntimeARM64` = `C:\bs-arm64\wineopenxr_a64.json`

An install from 0.2.0 or older also removes the old eye-tracking layer
(`XrApiLayer_bs_arm64_gaze`) and its registry entry.

The launch environment adds only `WINEDLLPATH=<prefix>/pfx/drive_c/bs-arm64` and the variables for
Valve's foveated rendering layer (below) to the usual Proton and Steam variables.

## Foveated rendering: Valve's fdm_injection

SteamOS ships Valve's foveated rendering as one library, `libVkLayer_VALVE_fdm_injection.so`, with two
halves:
- an **implicit OpenXR layer** (`XR_APILAYER_VALVE_fdm_injection`), active in every OpenXR app unless
  `DISABLE_VULKAN_FDM_INJECTION_LAYER` is set. It watches the swapchains and gets the eye-tracked
  foveation state from SteamVR.
- an **explicit Vulkan layer** (`VK_LAYER_VALVE_fdm_injection`), which attaches a fragment density map
  to the eye passes. Here that's DXVK's Vulkan device, so it works for the ARM64 build as for x64.

With Beat Saber's **Foveated Rendering** switch on, Steam starts the game with
`FDM_DEBUG=enable` and `VK_INSTANCE_LAYERS=VK_LAYER_VALVE_rpo:VK_LAYER_VALVE_fdm_injection`. Outside
Steam neither is set, only the OpenXR half loads, and `vkCreateDevice` spins forever. So every launch
needs one of:

| Want | Environment |
|---|---|
| foveated rendering | `FDM_DEBUG=enable` + `VK_INSTANCE_LAYERS=VK_LAYER_VALVE_rpo:VK_LAYER_VALVE_fdm_injection` |
| none | `DISABLE_VULKAN_FDM_INJECTION_LAYER=1` |

The OpenXR loader only checks whether `DISABLE_VULKAN_FDM_INJECTION_LAYER` exists, so an empty value
still disables it. `bs-arm64.sh launch` sets the second row, or the first with `--foveation`.

`FDM_DEBUG` is a flag list (`FDM_DEBUG=help` prints it): `enable`; presets `lo`, `med`, `hi`
(`hi` is the strongest foveation, the default is about `lo`); `zero` (zero density outside the view);
`disable_offsets`, `disable_layered`, `yflip`, `debug`. `VK_LAYER_VALVE_rpo` is a second Valve layer
Steam loads with it. The layer logs to stderr (`fdm_injection: created fdm views for size …`).

Up to 0.2.0, bs-arm64 had its own foveated rendering in DXVK plus an OpenXR layer for the eye data.
Valve's layer was faster (FINDINGS), so it was removed.

The loader's `XR_RUNTIME_JSON_ARM64` override did not take effect in our tests, even though other
variables such as `DXVK_LOG_LEVEL` reach the game. The cause hasn't been investigated, so the
registry value is what's actually used.

The Windows halves of lsteamclient and wineopenxr must match Proton's unix halves exactly: the
parameter structs and call numbers are generated per Proton version. `launch` refuses to start if
Proton was updated after install. Rebuild from the new Proton tag and reinstall.
